Reduce stock of parent product when a variable (child) product is sold

---

Problem:

"I have stock items with variations all of which have stock management; The problem is when I do sell a stock variation item the parent item stock count does not reduce !

Example:- I have a parent code which is a T-SHIRT and 3 variations S/M/L these variations have a combined stock value of 30 (10 each size) then I want my parent code to also show a stock value of 30; currently when i sell a stock variation item it only reduces the stock for that item and not the Parent item(sku).

Is there a plugin or code which will allow me to do this ?"
