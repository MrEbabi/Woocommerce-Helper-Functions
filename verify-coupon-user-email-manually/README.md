### Verify & Check user email when a coupon is applied without using standart email restriction on coupon creation

---

### Problem:

"
I have a coupon code called "SIGNUP10" that has to be made available to only users that have their email address in our mailchimp list. I know the coupon can be restricted to certain email addresses under "allowed emails" but I have a big mailchimp list and I need to make sure that the user applying this coupon has their email in our list.

Is there a woocoomerce hook that lets me check the email address after the coupon is entered and before the coupon is verified and applied to the cart?
