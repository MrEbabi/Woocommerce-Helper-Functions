### Check if the input number is a valid Order Number or not

---

### Problem: 

"In my WooCommerce store, I have an input field where I want the user to enter the order number. 
When validating this field, I need to check if that order number actually exists in WooCommerce.
PS: I suppose I could get all orders and loop through them one by one checking if the number matches, but I was hoping to find a simpler solution to this :D"
