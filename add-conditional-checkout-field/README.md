### Add conditionally a custom checkout field to shipping section in WooCommerce.

---

### Problem: 

"I have certain Woocommerce products that require the customer (or the product recipient) to provide a date of birth. Customers are required to provide date of birth when creating an account to check out so I'm all set there, but I need to add a required DOB field to the shipping section if "Ship to a different address" is checked and if any item in the cart is one where date of birth is required."
