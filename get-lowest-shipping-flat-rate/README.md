### Get lowest flat rate by traversing all shipping zones and methods.

---

### Problem: 

"What I want is simple: I want to display the lowest flat rate shipping cost on a product page in WooCommerce so I can display: "We already deliver orders from â‚¬ ...".

It doesn't matter what shipping zone of customer country is active... I just need the overall (static) lowest flat rate cost available."
