### Append product SKU's to product titles programmatically

---

Problem: 

"i want to add product sku to actual product title. for example, if product name is "Dress design" & product sku is "2790" the new product title should be "Dress design - 2790".

i had tried following code. but this code replaces the product title by the product SKU on single product pages.

but i want "product title + Sku", & i want to display it on single product page & shop page & checkout page & cart page."
