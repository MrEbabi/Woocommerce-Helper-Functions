### Stop WooCommerce For Reducing Stock On Abandoned Admin New Order

---

### Problem:

"If an admin goes to create an order but abandons it, the stock level is still reduced.

Steps to reproduce:

    install WordPress
    install WooCommerce
    create simple product and tick "manage stock?" and set stock level to 10
    view on front-end (see screenshot before.png)
    as admin create new order but don't save it (new -> order -> add item -> exit page)
    view on front-end (see screenshot after.png)
    Notice stock level has been reduced even those order wasn't saved.

Is there anyway to avoid this?"
